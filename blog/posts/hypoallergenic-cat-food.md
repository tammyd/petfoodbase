      Cat food allergies and intolerances are becoming increasingly more commonplace, and finding a hypoallergenic cat food that your cat
      can eat without symptoms can be a challenge.
      Cats with food allergies will frequently scratch their heads and necks, while those with intolerances
      may have gastrointestinal problems like diarrhea and vomiting. If your cat is first experiencing these systems,
      your first stop should always be your veterinarian. Your vet will do their analysis of your pet and may suggest an elimination
      diet or other treatments. You are your vet are partners in your cat's health, so please follow their advice if it makes sense to you!
