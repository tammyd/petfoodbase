For all but the most fortunate few, price is almost always a consideration when choosing what you feed your cat. It definitely
is a factor when I make my choices! That's why I'm super excited to be able to bring cat food pricing data to many of the products
listed here on CatFoodDB, thanks to our friends over at
<a href="http://tracking.chewy.com/aff_c?offer_id=4&aff_id=4635&source=blog" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">chewy.com</a>!

Due to that fact that prices can fluctuate, we've chosen to display product prices when available using a scale that ranges
from $ to $$$$$, cheapest to most expensive.


 | Price | Wet Food<br>Approx. cost per 3oz can| Dry Food<br>Approx. cost per 5lb bag |
 |-------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
 | $     | Less than $0.45 / 3oz can | Less than $8.00 / 5lb bag |
 | $$    | $0.45 - $0.75 / 3oz can | $8.00 - $16.00 / 5lb bag|
 | $$$   | $0.75 - $1.05 / 3oz can | $16.00 - $24.00 / 5lb bag |
 | $$$$  | $1.05 - $1.50 / 3oz can | $24.00 - $32.00 / 5lb bag |
 | $$$$$ | More than $1.50 / 3oz can | More than $32.00 / 5lb bag |


More pricing data will be added on a regular basis, so check back frequently for updates!
