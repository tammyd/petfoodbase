      <h2>CatFoodDB's Top Rated Wet Cat Foods</h2>

      <p>
      After months of research and analyzing information from 2200+ cat food products, I'm excited to finally be
        able to report on which wet cat food products ranked the best!<p>

      </p>
      <p>
      Every cat is different, so there is no one single best wet cat food.
      Allergies, health concerns, price and even the pickiness of your particular feline will all play a part in helping you determine what is the
        best wet cat food for your situation.
      </p>
      <p>
      However, analyzing all the data has shown me there are definitely different tiers of quality across the 1500+ wet cat food products I've looked at.
        Below you'll find {{ num }} of the best wet cat foods that scored the highest using my fact-based, unbiased analysis of each product using
        the manufacturer's published nutritional information.

      <h2>Analysis Criteria</h2>

      <p>When looking to find the highest quality cat food product, I'm primarily looking at two different properties of each particular variety. Pet foods
      manufactured in the United States and Canada are required to publish this information, so it makes sense that products can be
      compared against each other this way.</p>
      

      <p>Note that specialty varieties were excluded from this list. This means excluding all veterinary diets, and well as products specifically developed for kittens or senior cats. Cats requiring these specialty diets have their own unique dietary concerns and their products should often be evaluated on different criteria.</p>
      {#https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/52/PEO-chicken.svg/2000px-PEO-chicken.svg.png#}

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <p>Each product is given a score based on an analysis of its ingredient list. Those with a named protein or protein meal (ie "chicken" or "chicken meal") as
      their first ingredient are scored highest. Products with named proteins and meals in their top 5 ingredients are also scored better than those products without.
        Note that a generic "meat" or "fish" ingredient doesn't count as a protein in my evaluations; I find it rather suspicious that a
        manufacturer is unable or unwilling to identify the source of the protein!
      </p>

      <p>Products listing by-products, or bulk-adding fillers and grains in their top ingredient positions are scored lower. Additionally, any questionable preservatives included
      in the ingredient list will also reduce the product's score.</p>

      <h3>Nutrition</h3>
      <p>By law in North America, every commercially prepared cat food must publish a 'Guaranteed Analysis' that describes the percentages of protein,
      fat, fiber and moisture that are contained within the product. Although these aren't exact values, they do allow us to approximate and compare the total
      amount of protein and carbohydrates that are contained in each product.</p>

      <p>Similar to their ingredient score, each product is also scored based on its nutritional analysis
        - those products that have higher amounts of protein and lower amounts of carbohydrates reported in this nutritional breakdown are scored higher.</p>

      <h2>The Results</h2>
      <p>The {{ num }} products below scored highest of all the products in the CatFoodDB database, each earning either 9 or 10 paws for their nutrition levels and ingredient lists.
        All are high in protein, low in carbohydrates, and are free of starchy fillers and by-products.
      </p>
      <p>Note however that this is by no means the full list of the best products reviewed here on CatFoodDB. In fact,
        choosing just {{ num }} varieties was a really hard task, and in the end the raw
      numbers chose the winners - the products below had the highest scores, lowest
        calculated carbohydrate values and highest amounts of protein. However, it's important to keep in mind that the
      protein and especially the carbohydrate numbers are only estimated values.  Although each cat food manufacturer is required by law to publish a Guaranteed Analysis
        that defines each product's maximum values of fiber and moisture in addition to its minimum values of protein and fat,
        exact nutritional percentages are not available and hence all calculated values, including carbohydrates, are determined using these
        minimum and maximum published values and may differ from actual values.
